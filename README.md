# Group projects
Welcome visitor!
Here, you'll discover a collection of projects developed by me and many others, using technologies within the .NET framework and languages such as JavaScript and C#.
Each project contains a detailed description of the project's purpose and functionality,
providing insights into the problem it solves or the concept it explores.
## Feel free to check out my group projects and let me know what you think!
